Bugs: 
- Course details not display courses for students *it is saving in database*
-Student details--

- StudentCourse and Course within student are doing some of the same things. (i.e., redundancies in code, may or may not throw errors)

- CourseDepartment is currently many to many (i.e., many departments to one course, or many courses to one department). should be many courses to 1 department, but 1 department for 1 singular course

new carl code in students controller:
public ActionResult Details(int id)
    {
      Student thisStudent = _db.Students
        .Include(thing => thing.JoinStudent)
        .ThenInclude(thing => thing.Course)
        .FirstOrDefault(student => student.StudentId == id);

      (our code below.....carl code above)
      // Student thisStudent = _db.Students
      //                           .Include(course => course.Course)
      //                           .ThenInclude(course => course.JoinStudent)
      //                           .ThenInclude(join => join.Course)
      //                           .FirstOrDefault(student => student.StudentId == id);
      return View(thisStudent);
    }

Stretch Goals:
- checkboxes for student and courses.(adding students to courses)
- Check if list already contains course or dept or student.
